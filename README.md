# HashtagSearch
An ASP.NET MVC Web Application that can search Twitter for popular tweets matching a specified hashtag.

## Notes
We could use a C# twitter library from NuGet, such as Tweetinvi instead of the TwitterClientLibrary. However, due to the simplicity of the design specifications, we can create something a lot smaller and lightweight.
